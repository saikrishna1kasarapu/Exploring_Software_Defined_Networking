Project Overview:

This project explores the concepts of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using Mininet and POX controllers. The objective was to understand how SDN can enhance network management and improve communication efficiency.

Key Features:

Custom Network Topology:

Developed a binary tree network topology using Mininet, providing a structured environment for testing SDN concepts.

SDN Controllers:

Programmed SDN controllers using POX to manage packet forwarding and network operations effectively.

MAC Learning Controller:
Implemented a MAC learning controller that dynamically learns MAC addresses, optimizing packet forwarding processes.

Flow Rules Integration:

Enhanced the MAC learning controller by integrating flow rules on OpenFlow switches, improving overall network performance and communication between hosts.

Conclusion:

This project highlights the practical applications of Software-Defined Networking, demonstrating how custom topologies and programmable controllers can optimize network efficiency. By integrating advanced features like MAC learning and flow rules, the project provides valuable insights into the capabilities of SDN in real-world networking scenarios.
